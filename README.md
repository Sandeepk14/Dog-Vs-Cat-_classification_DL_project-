# Dog-Vs-Cat-_classification_DL_project-
 The Dog vs Cat Classification project uses deep learning to classify images as either dogs or cats. It involves preparing a labeled dataset, preprocessing images (resizing, normalization, augmentation), and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or using transfer learning with pre-trained models.
